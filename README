Notes About cache-sim:

Extra credit is done using Least Frequently Used(LFU) replacement 
algorithm. To make it work, each slot(each way in a set) has a counter
associated with that way to count how many accesses occur to the way. When a 
victim has to be chosen, victim is selected to be the one having 
the least number of accessses in the corresponding set.
Both replacements and hits increment the value that is used to keep track
of Least Frequently Used way in the corresponding set. 

Extra credit results are directly written to the standard output.
Improvement in performance is obvious if there is 8 or 16 ways in a set.
Significant performance improvement is observed with instructions 
provided in trace1 and trace3 for caches that are either 8 or 16 ways.
